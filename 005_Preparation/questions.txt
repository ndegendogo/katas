Code Katas Preparation
Prepare yourself with the following topics:
- the programs "echo", "cat", "head", "tail", "sort", "wc" (Basic Features and most important options only)
- Roman numbers (normative form only, 1990 is MCMXC and not MXM)
- Bowling rules (game process w/ respect to score)
I guess you already know a lot about these things, so I hope that your preparation will be quick.
