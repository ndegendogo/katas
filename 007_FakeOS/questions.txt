for Fake OS, Product Management has decided to take the next step.
Part of this is providing command line programs that resemble specific
UNIX command line programs.

Story 1: Echo.java which prints zero or more strings, then a newline.
Story 2: Cat.java which concatenates files or stdin to stdout.
Story 3: Head.java which prints the first 10 lines from files or stdin
to stdout.
Story 4: Tail.java which prints the last 10 lines from files or stdin to stdout.
Story 5: Sort.java which sorts lines from files or stdin to stdout.
Story 6: WC.java which counts characters, words and lines from files
or stdin to stdout.

I'm the product owner. Also discuss the acceptance criteria and
definition of done with me.
