Testing:
Now let's see how we would test Hello.java. Of course it seems overkill doing so. Indeed the simplicity of Hello.java doesn't justify testing. Testing Hello.java in a real world scenario would be insane. It would be like applying double-entry book-keeping when you have no real business and all you do is selling your used bicycle to your friend. But even if it looks insane, maybe you applied double-entry book-keeping, balance charts and depreciation for the sake of learning and understanding these techniques?

Thus we will test Hello.java purely for the sake of exercise. The nice thing about Hello.java is that it is so simple that we can put all our focus on testing aspects without any distraction.

1. I could test Hello.java by running the program and verifying its output.
1.1 What type of test is this? Give at least three terms used by the industry for this type of test.
1.2 Which term is the primary term used by software craftsmen and agilists for this type of test?
1.3 You rewrite Hello in a different language? Can this type of test be reused? What constrains the reuse of this type of test?
1.4 Try to write a makefile which performs the test.
1.5 Try to write an ant script which performs the test.
1.6 Try to write a maven script which performs the test.
1.7 Try to write a gradle script which performs the test.

2. I could test Hello.java by calling its methods and verifying their behavior or state changes.
2.1 What type of test is this? Give at least three terms used by the industry for this type of test.
2.2 Which term is the primary term used by software craftsmen for this type of test?
2.3 You rewrite Hello in a different language. Can this type of test be reused? What constrains the reuse of this type of test?
2.4 Write such a test using JUnit without modifying Hello.java.
2.5 Write such a test using TestNG without modifying Hello.java.
2.6 While it was possible to write these tests, there was a major issue that had to be solved. What was that issue and how did you solve it?
2.7 What change would make testing of Hello.java easier? Try to explain this using the SOLID principles.
2.8 How would the design have looked like if you would've first written the tests?
2.9 Change the design of Hello, world to simplify your tests.
2.10 Imagine, Hello, world would be a huge application. What impact has the influence of tests on the application architecture / design? How is this related to the SOLID principles? How is this related to the primary value of Software? How is this related to Conway's law?

3. TDD and pair programming
- Which types of tests were not mentioned in 1. and 2.? Name at least four and try to describe how they fit in the picture.
- What is the RGF-cycle?
- What are the three laws of TDD?
- What are the names of the roles in pair programming? 
- Which role has the keyboard?
- Which role is responsible for tactics / local thinking?
- Which role is responsible for strategy / global thinking?
- What is ping pong? How is ping pong related to TDD?
- If one developer is more experienced than the other, does this influence the roles? How? By what should you measure success in that case?
- Can you do TDD without pair programming? What do you lose? What do you gain?
- Can you do pair programming without TDD? What do you lose? What do you gain?
- What is the single assert rule?
- What are the "4 As"?
- What is BDD? How do the 4 As relate to BDD?

4. Java arrays
- What are the three possible syntax variants for declaring a Java variable of array type?
- Which of these is "unnatural" for Java and why? Why is it still supported? What do most code conventions say about that? What is your software craftsman opinion on that?
- Which of these is very limited in where it can be used? What is the benefit of this syntax variant?
