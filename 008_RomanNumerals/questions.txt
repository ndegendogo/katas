implement Roman Numerals with TDD.

Here's the task:

Marketing has decided that we no longer number the games of the game
serials with Arabic numbers but with Roman numerals.

(Story 1: -> see 006_RomanNumerals)

Story 2: As a sales person, I need a program that converts a Roman
numeral into an Arabic number.

I am your product owner. When in doubt, ask me any time.
I want to see this as if it were a full-fledged product, starting with
estimation and interface design.
Use TDD for the implementation. Roman Numerals is ideal for TDD.

Hints: Be as strict with the process as possible: Extract methods
whenever possible ("braces are an opportunity to extract").
The funny thing about Roman Numerals is, the more strict you are, the
faster, more correct and more maintainable the solution becomes.
More Hints: 1990 is MCMXC but not MXM. 1999 is MCMXCIX but not MCMIC or MIM.

Product Owner:
The sales guy won't be able to handle a command line application.
He'll need a GUI thingy.
